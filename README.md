# Bottom-Tab-Navigation-in-React-Native

This code creates a bottom tab navigation for a mobile app using React Native
and the @react-navigation/bottom-tabs package.
It defines a Tab.Navigator with five Tab.Screen components, each representing a different screen in the app:
⚡ Home, 
⚡ Quotes,
⚡ Search, 
⚡ Orders, 
⚡ Account. 
Each Tab.Screen specifies an icon and label for the tab, along with the component it should render when the tab is selected.
